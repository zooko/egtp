    The policy of this listener is like this:

    You keep a list of N preferred relay servers.  Every five minutes you "go shopping", fetch a list of relay servers, handicap them, and insert the winner as the 0th element in your list of preferred relay servers.  This pushes the previous top relayer down to being your second-favorite and so on (unless of course your previous top *is* the new winner of the handicapping in which case there's no change).  (Also, if you get a transaction failure with your current preferred relayer then you go shopping.)

    You poll your preferred relay server every 60 seconds, your second-most-preferred relay server every 120 seconds, and your third-most-preferred every 240 seconds.

    Anytime you receive a message from any relayer, then you schedule a poll for 60 seconds later to that relayer.

    Finally, whenever you receive a message from any relayer then there is a 50% chance that the relayer will get "promoted".  Being promoted means, if you are already in the preferredrelayers list, that you swap places with the relayer above you, and if you are not already in the preferred relayers list, that you get inserted in the middle of the list (thus pushing the least preferred one right off the list).

    This means that you switch your preferred relay server any time that handicapping shows there is a better one, but we have add a "stick with what works" handicapper to try to dampen any churn of switching between relayers (by giving a 500 point handicap to any counterparty that isn't our current preferred relay server.

    Things to do:
    * fix up and tune latency handicap (just use the dynamic-timers statistics instead of gathering separate ones) and reliability handicap
