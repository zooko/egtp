How to install:

You simply need to check out the source from public cvs and run "make" to build 
it.  For step-by-step directions, please read "cvsinstall.sh" in the egtp/ 
directory, or at this URL:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/egtp/egtp/cvsinstall.sh?content-type=text/plain


How to learn the API:

0.  Read the file named "Tutorial.txt" in the egtp/ directory.

1.  The example: Look at EGTPunittest.py, in the function named 
`_help_test_EGTP_send_and_receive()' to see basic operation of creating nodes 
and sending and receiving messages.

2.  The interface that provides messaging:  Look at the interface of class Node in Node.py.

3.  The interfaces that provide lookup and discovery:  Look at the interfaces for lookup managers, 
lookup handlers, discovery managers, and discovery handlers in interfaces.py.

3.a.
    You can see implementations of the manager classes (local, non-distributed, for-testing-only) in 
    EGTPtest.py.

3.b.
    You can see how EGTP uses the manager classes in MojoTransaction.py (see how it uses the 
    `self._lookupman' member) and RelayListener.py (see how it uses the `self._discoveryman' member).

3.c.
    You can see how EGTP defines and uses handler classes in MojoTransaction.py 
    (class LookupHand) and in RelayListener.py (class ShoppingResultsHand).
