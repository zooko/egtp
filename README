How to learn the API:

1.  The example: Look at EGTPtest.py, in the function named `test_1()' to see basic operation of 
creating nodes and sending and receiving messages.

2.  The interface that provides messaging:  Look at the interface of class Node in Node.py.

3.  The interfaces that provide lookup and discovery:  Look at the interfaces for lookup managers, 
lookup handlers, discovery managers, and discovery handlers in interfaces.py.

3.a.
    You can see implementations of the manager classes (local, non-distributed, for-testing-only) in 
    EGTPtest.py.

3.b.
    You can see how EGTP uses the manager classes in MojoTransaction.py (see how it uses the 
    `self._lookupman' member) and RelayListener.py (see how it uses the `self._discoveryman' member).

3.c.
    You can see how EGTP defines and uses handler classes in MojoTransaction.py 
    (class LookupHand) and in RelayListener.py (class ShoppingResultsHand).
