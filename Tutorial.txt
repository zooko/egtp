Introduction to the EGTP API:

EGTP is a system for sending messages between nodes in a peer to peer network.  This Tutorial will 
show you how to instantiate an EGTP node, send messages to other nodes, and process messages sent 
to your node.  Currently this functionality is available only via a Python API, but other 
languages (including XML-RPC and C) will be supported as soon as someone wants it enough.

This Tutorial will contain snippets of Python code.  You can see complete, running code by looking 
in the EGTPunittest.py file, at the function named `_help_test_EGTP_send_and_receive()'.  It might 
be helpful to compare the code snippets in the Tutorial with the running code in that unit test 
while reading the Tutorial.


0.  Installing and Building the Software

See the "README" file in the egtp/ directory.


1.  Initializing EGTP

First import the Python module:

>>> import Node

Now before using Node for anything, you have to call `Node.init()'.

>>> Node.init()


2.  Creating an EGTP Node

>>> mynode = Node.Node(lookupman, discoveryman)

Hey waitasecond -- what are these "lookupman" and "discoveryman" things?  Well, 

Each EGTP node has a unique ID which is cryptographically determined by the node's public key.
